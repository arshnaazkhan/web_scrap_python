# Web Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup

This Python script demonstrates how to scrape data from a website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. It's a sample code for scraping product information from a web page and saving it as JSON.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required Python packages using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

    
    pip install selenium beautifulsoup4
   

3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser. In this example, we're using Microsoft Edge, so you'll need the Microsoft Edge WebDriver. Download it from the official website:

   [Microsoft Edge WebDriver Downloads](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)

4. Specify the path to the WebDriver executable in the code. Replace `'path/to/msedgedriver.exe'` with the actual path to your WebDriver.

## Usage

1. Customize the `base_url` and `num_pages` in the script to match your web scraping needs. `base_url` should point to the page you want to scrape, and `num_pages` should be set to the number of pages you want to scrape.

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python webscraper.py
    ```

3. The script will scrape the data and save it as a JSON file named `dog_food_data.json` in the same directory.

## Customization

- You can modify the code to scrape different data from the website by changing the HTML element selectors and attributes.
- Adjust the waiting time and timeout values in the code to suit the loading speed of the website.
